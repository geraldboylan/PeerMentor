          Your resume is of utmost importance during the application process. It 
          gives you a chance to promote your knowledge, skills and past experience 
          to potential employers. Internships at large firms can often be extremely 
          competitive, hence, an excellent resume that is neatly laid out is essential 
          in these cases.

          Cover Letter Resources

        <p>
          Cover letters give the employer a chance to assess your suitability for the 
          role. They are very important in the application process and you should 
          provide one with your application even if you are <strong>not</strong> asked to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          To showcase your suitability for a role it is best to match your skills to 
          the job description. The company is telling you what they want in the job 
          description so if you can prove that you are what they want, you will be 
          in a good position to get an interview.

          Interviews allow the employer to assess potential candidates 
          by seeing how well their skills and personality match the firm 
          and position that's being filled. It is the first time in the 
          application process where you get to display your personality 
          and character (until this stage in the application you have 
          only submitted words on a page). Many employers have started 
          using pre-recorded interviews, which is when no interviewer 
          is present, instead you are asked a question on the 
          computer/laptop and your response is recorded and sent to 
          be reviewed. You should prepare for these interviews just 
          like a regular interview and dress appropriately.

          Psychometric Test Practice
        </h1>
        <p>
          Psychometric tests are a standardised method to measure 
          cognitive abilities, personality and behavioural style. 
          They are used by employers to assess how well a 
          candidate's attributes match those required for the role. 
          Practice versions of these tests are usually provided by 
          the companies that use them in the application process, 
          however, these practice tests tend to be less difficult 
          than the real thing. The more practice with this method 
          of testing, the better you will get at it!
