    <h1>PeerMentor</h1>
    <h2>Project Proposal by Gerry Boylan</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      PeerMentor is a website that will be designed to put University students
      seeking internships in contact with University students who have completed
      those internships. The students seeking the internships can then be
      mentored by someone who has gone through the application process
      successfully in recent years. When someone visits the website, they will
      be able to browse through potential mentors where they can view that
      mentors work experience, education and bio until they find a mentor that
      interests them.
    </p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      The objective of this website is to offer students much needed assistance
      throughout the job/internship application process from people a year or 2
      ahead of them at school who have gone through the whole process. I have
      encountered this problem before and the current solution of reaching out
      to strangers on LinkedIn and hoping they reply is not up to scratch.
    </p>
    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>
      My target audience consists of university students seeking professional
      work experience. Nowadays it is nearly a necessity to have professional
      work experience upon leaving university for business/tech/engineering
      majors so this is a sizeable target audience.
    </p>
    <h3>Content</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        PeerMentor will consist of a <em>homepage</em>, where students can learn
        how to use the website, along with a search bar so that they can easily
        search for Mentors who have completed work experience in certain
        firms/job positions/locations. It will additionally have a Top Mentors
        sections where they can quickly chat to the best rated mentors on the
        site.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <em>Find Mentor</em> page, were students can browse through the full
        selection of mentors that we have listed on the site. If they see a
        mentor that interests them, they can click on their profile and it will
        take them to a...
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Individual Mentor</em> page, where the student will be able to read
        through the work experience, education and bio of that particular
        Mentor. If the student believes that the Mentor is a good fit for them
        they will click on...
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Chat with Mentor</em> where they can ask questions concerning their
        application and receive answers from the Mentor.
      </li>
      <li>
        There will also be an <em>Application Enhancer</em> page where students
        can click through generic advice about various sections of an
        application in multiple different industries from the Mentors.
